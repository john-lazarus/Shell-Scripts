This Bash Script is intended to Run on Ubuntu Distros. I have been able to only test this with Ubunutu 16.04 but it should work just fine with any Ubuntu version based on SYSTEMD and the newer APT (not apt-get). The only reason of using the half-compatible APT is because I like a good verbose output.

It also contains an 'Optional' LAMP installation Section for Troubleshooting Purposes. For most users, it's better off having stayed commented out since python-bottle can host itself and is MUCH LIGHTER on resources as compared to the whole LAMP Stack running on a system. Read more about it here: https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/

Feel free to add or take from this Script. Suggestions and Improvements are always welcome, Thanks!
